# How It's Made:

CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Sessions, Bcrypt

---

# Optimizations:

One function we didn't have time to add to our MVP quite yet is an autocomplete to make it easier to add Pokemon to your deck.

Another functionality being planned out is to make favorites viewable by other users, so you can show off your best Poke squad.

# Lessons Learned: 

How important structure is for group work - use of sprints and deliverables to push an MVP and to add functionality afterward, frameworks like Kanban for visualizing progress on tasks, etc

Git branch management is vital to keep track of individual commits as more is continually added to the main repo

---

# Install all the dependencies or node packages used for development via Terminal

# Things to add
